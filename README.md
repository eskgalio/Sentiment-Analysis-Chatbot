## 🧠 Mental Health Chatbot

### AI-Powered Conversational Support for Mental Well-being

> An intelligent, AI-powered mental health chatbot that uses NLP and deep learning to understand and respond to user queries about emotional well-being. Built with Flask, Python, and advanced ML models for empathetic, real-time support. Ideal for students, portfolio display, and mental health awareness apps.

## 📌 Scope

This project aims to develop a **Mental Health Chatbot** that provides emotional support through meaningful, context-aware conversations. It combines sentiment analysis, intent detection, and deep learning to create a virtual assistant capable of understanding and responding to users struggling with stress, anxiety, or depressive thoughts.

It includes:

* End-to-end **ML model training** using LSTM/Deep Learning for emotion classification.
* **EDA & NLP preprocessing pipelines** to refine textual mental health data.
* A **Flask-based chatbot API** for real-time interaction.
* Integration-ready frontend for demonstration purposes.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze mental health-related conversations using machine learning.
* Predict user intent and sentiment to generate empathetic responses.
* Provide a safe, non-judgmental environment for users to express feelings.
* Enable scalable deployment of mental health chat interfaces.
